            <h3>Distribution of Wins vs. Average Win Probability</h3>
            <p><img src="images/Bulls_Wins_vs_Prob.png" class="img-fluid">
              <br/><br/>
              The scatter plot chart above depicts the distribution of Bulls team wins by season, in relation to the same season-averaged win probability, or winning expectation. In a clearly strong positive linear correlation, historical Bulls teams appear to perform approximately as anticipated by this metric in terms of winning games in line with expectations. There are two glaring outliers however, including the franchise-worst 13 win 1999 season in which the team was expected to win just under 50% of its games, but managed to win just under 16% instead.
              This can likely be explained however, as the first season subsequent to the complete dismantling of the formerly dominant group, including the departures of head coach Phil Jackson, and star core players Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. It is highly likely that the metric for expected win percentage did not accurately (or in a timely enough manner) reflect such a drastic shift from what was previously a consistently prolific professional basketball dynasty.
              <br/><br/>
              The remaining outlier is the 2012 Bulls team which actually won 50 (over 75%) of its 66 lockout-shortened regular season games and two playoff games, before being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. Because the regular season was shortened by a significant 16 games (or just under 20% of a normal season's duration) however, the overall win total does fall outside of the expected total win distribution.
