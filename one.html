              The line graphs above depict both the team's average point total on a per game basis, as well as the overall win totals by season, on a shared x-axis. 
              Somewhat surprisingly, the historically highest scoring Bulls teams took the courts in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though when viewed contextually along with overall league-wide scoring trends, this statistic becomes a bit less surprising<sup>1</sup>.
              <br/><br/>
              Certainly less surprising is that the winningest Bulls teams played in the early 1990s during the onset of the "Jordan Era", which was followed by a steep decline during Jordan's departure from the league during the entire 1994 season and large part of 1995.
              The full trend was ultimately capped by a sharp spike following Jordan's return, culminating in the team's (at the time) record-setting 72 win 1996 regular season campaign. 
              That team also went on to win 15 total playoff games, including four NBA Finals games en route to the franchise's fourth title.
